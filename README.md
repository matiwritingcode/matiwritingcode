# About Me

## :construction: Like any good craft, this is always a work in progress

Hello hello! This is me, Mat√≠as, talking to you. I bet you're tired of asking and answering the same questions over and over. Good news: reading this will take less than 10 minutes, and you'll come away with a general idea of my work style and preferences, beyond what you can find on LinkedIn or a CV. I'm writing in the tone I usually use in day to day conversations. Of course, when needed, I can be formal and professional. But this is the real me, just another fellow dev on the team, talking to you before or after a meeting, when there's a bit of time to get to know each other better. Since we spend a big chunk of our daylight working, I think it's important to feel comfortable with the people we work with.

## Day to day workflows

- I'm careful about requirements. When I pick a ticket, I read the AC (if provided), understand what the ticket is about and what it's not. Ask clarification questions if needed. Attach evidence after completing the task. After the work is done, I link to the ticket in the PR description as well. If we don't have someone who write the proper AC, I'll try to do it in the more detailed way possible.
- I like to be familiar with codebase and workflow before starting to code. I always try to keep an eye on the PRs, even if I'm not the reviewer. It helps me to have context about the current state of our app.
- When I identify what part of the codebase I need to touch, I also inspect about the git history to have more context about the changes: last change? Who did it? Is he still in the team? If so, I can drop him/her a direct message to chat more about the change/suggestions/context.
- Before diving into the code, I like to have a plan about what I'm going to do. I create an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note with a checklist of the tasks I need to complete. It helps me to stay focused and to have a reference of what I need to do. In that way, If I need to attend a meeting, I can stop what I'm doing and start from where I left off. The checklist also helps me to split the problem into smaller chunks (The famous "divide and conquer", you know).
- If I need to tackle a complex feature after discussing it with the team/client, I'll also have a general discussion with the AI assistant of choice (Cursor, chatGPT, etc). From there, I'll create a markdown file with the plan, the steps, the context, the assumptions, the risks, the alternatives. It doesn't take too long and makes my life easier because those AI agents can be a bit of a pain in the ass when losing context.
- About AI hints: sometimes they are useful, sometimes they are not. I've been using them for a while now and I'm always learning the best way to use them. Sometimes when I really need to focus and follow my own ideas, I switch to the good old vim editor to at least sketch the ideas or to follow the app's workflow carefully. Pen and paper is also a good option.
- If I need to use a specficic library, even if I know partially or not at all, I take a look at the docs. I believe now it's even more important than ever since AI tool can hallucinate or bullshit you along the way. It's always good to know them from their creators perspective.
- Branch per feature is a must of course
- I like to write good docs and keep them fresh. Maybe I'm starting a new project, maybe I'm adding a complex feature, maybe I'm modifying a long time workflow or updating/removing/replacing some dependencies. Have cool written docs is always a warm welcome to any project
- Tests? I see them not only as a way to protect the code and perform changes over a solid ground, but also as a way to understand code you didn't write: you can learn from assertions, edge cases, types, etc. In the real world, some projects don't have a good test coverage: in those cases, one common suggestion I give is to add some checks in the pre-commit/pre-push hooks as a starting point. We can think about some minimum desired coverage to achieve as a team. We can start to print the coverage report in the pipeline. And we can start to write tests for the meaningful/critical parts of the app's workflow to start with. There are a lot more of suggestions about them. TODO: create a separated Tests section: talk about vitest extension to code editor, creating mocks, writing docs to establish a solid ground for the tests, etc.

## As a team member

- I consider myself a team player (yeah, dull topic but it's true). I believe this: we deliver as a team, it's not about pride nor isolation
- I try to be proactive: suggest improvements, ask questions, speak up
- I try to collaborate about architecture and design, with suggestions and feedback. Once I get to know our codebase, bottlenecks, pain points (those nasty huge legacy classes...), I try to at least refactor them even a bit if I have time and I have a ticket related to that code. Then, as frontend dev, is a must to get fluid talk also with design team to understand their needs, the way they call from their designers perspective the components we have in our codebase, etc. And of course, If I find some inconsistencies, I'll be happy to share my thoughts about them.
- I enjoy to mentor people. We know this can be a tough field to land in, so I try to help as much as I can. Or If I know a particular tech stack, I'll be happy to share my knowledge. It's nice to share knowledge.
- Ticket effort estimation: it depends on the team dynamics but I also have in mind qa efforts and unit tests.
- Some topics are better to discuss with the team on separated meetings, sometimes a topic is not worth to be discussed in the daily but on an quick huddle or slack. It all depends on the topic and the team dynamics.
- At this stage of my career, I don't like nor need to be micro-managed. I like to be trusted and given the freedom to do my job. If It's not about lack of communication. If we agree to a particular deadline, I'll meet it. If I need to work until midnight, I'll do it. If I need to work until 3am, I'll do it. If I need help or have questions, I'll ask. As I mentioned before, We win as a team. It's not about pride nor ego. It's about the team. Stakeholders don't mind about who did what, they just want the job done. If we deliver a good product on time, everyone is happy thus we win. That way we can work in peace, without stress and without rushing. Stakeholders will be more open to our suggestions and we can work in a more collaborative way.

## Some rules of thumb

- Avoid premature optimizations. Of course we need to deliver a good product, but we don't have to optimize something that is not a problem yet.
- No premature abstractions: as [Sandi Metz](https://sandimetz.com/) suggests, one have to wait until the proper abstraction emerges
- Write self-documenting code, Uncle Bob style.
- SOLID principles, KISS, DRY, YAGNI
- For this field is about delivering value to the stakeholders. That help to prioritize my efforts accordingly.

## What I enjoyed lately

- Researching and learning new things: create a POC, prepare a presentation, share my insights with the team
- TODO: polish. Improve UI performance: I found out that third world people can't afford to have a fast internet connection, so we have to make sure our app is fast enough. Also mobile plans are expensive for them, so we have to make sure our app is light enough. So some ideas: use responsive images with the proper format, lazy loading, reduce the number of requests we send to the server, use the proper cdn, etc.
- Enhance pipelines to make them more efficient and our lives easier (biome and lefthook are really nice tools to be honest)
- I had to handle a mixpanel server side migration (company was using client side version but a lot of valuable data was lost because of adblockers) TODO: talk about and the ip related issues because of cloudflare

## Approach to testing

## Javascript | Typescript | React | Node

### Coding style preferences

_(TODO: Section pending)_

### Libraries

- How do I choose them? First of all, I evaluate if we really need to add an external dependency to our project. Sometimes (and even more now with the rise of the AI agents) we can use the native features of the language to write a reusable function/class/module to solve the problem avoiding all the overhead of a new library. If that's not the case, I'll evaluate the following:
- Perform a google search / Team and AI chat discussion
- Check the github repo:
  - Stars: it's a matter of adoption
  - Updated: it's a matter of maintenance
  - Open issues/PRs: it's a matter of trust

### Misc

- Read the docs, some related blog posts, maybe a youtube tutorial and just then chat with AI about the best way to implement it
- If the scrum master can't conduct the daily, I can help to fill the gap that day
- I have no problem to guide demos with technical or non-technical audience. It's important to identify the audience and prepare the content accordingly. If they are technical, it's even not the same if they are upper management (I assume they know a lot of things but have less time to dive into the details, so I need to go straight to the point) for example.
- Always have in mind that this is money business, so you don't have to get trapped in the perfectionist rabbit hole. It's all about delivering value to the customer playing with the variables you have in your hands: First create a good enough solution. Then if you have time, you can improve it. There are always trade-offs. And of course, there are minimum non-negotiable code standards you have to follow.
- Talk to the client, understand their needs, their pain points, their goals. Help them to understand what they "really" want. Reduce complexities and buzzwords noise so they can choose the best solution for their own business. Deliver proper solutions for the problems at hand keeping in mind the business goals and future enhancements.
- Some times atomic design can be a good fit. It depends on the project.
- MACH architecture is interesting for ecommerce projects.
- If I have to start something from scratch, I would start with a lean project with clean architecture and good code standards. Create a solid foundation. Example: a few good tests, a few good docs, some adapter-like to serve as intermediate layer between our code and the external world so we can switch between them if needed. Then if needed, add more complexity and if needed more external dependencies.

## How I onboard

- Who are our stakeholders? One has to identify the stakeholders and their needs. Technical? Non-technical? What they value the most? What they hate?
- Read the onboarding documents if any.
- Write my own onboarding document. Create a glossary of relevant terms. If the team finds it useful, we then maybe convert it into a more official one.
- Company is hiring me? What are the expectations? Which coworkers I'll be closely working with? Which coworkers are the role models the company wants to have in the team?
- What are the pain points?
- What are the goals?
- What are the success metrics?
- How are the team dynamics?
- Common tools the team is using?
- Ssh config, aliases, repo access, etc.
- Look open PRs, attend to the discussions, ask questions, try to identify patterns I've used in the past, try to suggest alternatives, etc.
- Common codebase areas I try to get familiar with at first:
  - Repo structure
  - Project structure
  - Codebase style
  - How the frontend communicates with the backend, contracts, types, etc.
  - Identify design patterns, architecture patterns it any. Try to grasp the project's architecture big picture. How the key entities interact with each other.
  - How are deploys done?
  - Client side state management
  - How the styles are handled
  - Do we have a style guide?
  - Styles? Design System? Figma?
  - Do we have test? How are they written? Which are the priorities?
  - I also take a look at package.json dependencies to understand the tech stack we are using
  - Take a look at the Dockerfile

## Common tools

- How to use code AI assisted code editors: if I'm going to use them to develop a feature, I'll create a markdown file with requirements, suggestions, general idea. Maybe even a general audio discussion with ChatGPT. Cursor rules or similar. Then sketch a step by step plan in the markdown file. Then iterate over it.
- Tmux
- Obsidian
- Cursor: tweaks, extensions, keybindings
- zsh and aliases
- Browser extensions
- nvm
- If I didn't have a good night and keeping focus is difficult, the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) always saves my day and I found this [elegant implementation](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) the right tool to help me

## How I clear my mind

- Take a short walk
- Cooking
- Calisthenics - Functional strength training
- Clean the house
- Take a break for that particular challenge and switch to another simpler one or a different topic like updating docs, writing tests, etc.

## How I debug

- Browser extensions:
  - [React Developer Tools]()
  - [Context dev tools]

_(TODO: Section pending)_

## Communication

TODO: Section pending

- One has to wear different hats, one per micro-interaction: scrum master needs to hear about some things, product owner needs to hear about other things, etc.
  - PO:
  - SM:
  - Fellow Devs:
    - JR:
    - SR:
  - QAs:
  - Tech leaders:

## People on our field I admire

These are people I admire and I enjoy following their work and learn from them. They don't work with same tech stack neither the same field. Some of them are more into ruby, some of them into python, some of them of course into javascript. Some of them are more into backend, some of them into frontend, some of them into machine learning. But they are all awesome. The beauty of them is that they do not talk about what they do, but they talk about what they believe in. Then, you can extrapolate patterns, ideas, workflows and techniques to improve your work.

Bonus track, 2 non-IT books: I find [Polya's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) method really useful to deal with our daily (not only technical) challenges. And when it comes to self motivation, [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow) from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi left me a few good teachings.
